### Looking to Analyze and answer these questions:
1. Number of duplicate song names, most common song names.
2. Artists with most songs
3. Artists with most number of views
4. Artists with the highest dancibility 
5. Most popular artists with explicit lyrics, non-explicit lyrics
6. Is there a correlation between danceability and duration_ms ?
7. Correlation between danceability and energy?
8. Correlation between danceability and explit lyrics? - are more songs with explicit lyrics danceable, or non-explicit (kind of a crude analysis...)
9. Multi-artist songs: how does popularity compare between songs made by 1 artist or multiple artists?
10. Remix analysis vs. the original songs - are remixes more popular or more danceable or energetic in general?
